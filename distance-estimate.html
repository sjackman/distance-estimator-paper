<h1>Abstract</h1>

<p>
The estimation of distances between two sequences based on the
paired-end reads that span the gap between them is a common and
perhaps even necessary task of <i>de novo</i> assembly.
</p>

<h1>The data and problem</h1>

<p>
The goal is to estimate the size of the gap between two sequences.
The data is obtained by mapping the reads to the two sequences in
question. The two sequences are ordered and oriented to agree with the
orientation of the reads. We establish a coordinate system where
-1 is the last base of the first sequence and 0 is the first base of
the second sequence, which we will refer to as the origin. A putative
fragment size is calculated for each mate pair by taking the
difference between the mapped position of the first sequenced base of
the two reads. This putative fragment size differs from the actual
fragment size by the size of the gap between the two sequences.
</p>

<p>
The final input is the distribution of fragment sizes of the library,
which may be specified or may be derived empirically by mapping the
reads to a reference sequence or sequences assembled <i>de novo</i>.
</p>

<h1>Naïve estimate by comparing a statistic of the population and
sample distributions
</h1>

<p>
At first glance, this task appears to be rather simple, and a simple
solution presents itself readily. A summary statistic, such as the
median or mean, of the size of the fragments spanning the gap between
two sequences can be calculated. Given <i>a priori</i> knowledge of
the distribution of fragment sizes of a library, a reasonable
estimate, <i>θ</i>, of the actual size of the gap,
<i>θ₀</i>, is the difference between the mean of the
population, <i>μ</i>, and the mean of the sample, <i>x̄</i>.
</p>

<p class="caption">

<div class="formula">
	<i>θ</i> = <i>μ</i> - <i>x̄</i>
</div>
</p>

<h1>Maximum likelihood estimate (MLE)</h1>

<p>
The estimate of the distance between the two sequences can be improved
by using the probability distribution in its entirety rather than a
summary statistic. For a fragment size <i>x</i>, the probability of
seeing a fragment of size <i>x</i> selected at random from the
population is <i>f(x)</i>.
</p>

<p>
With a sample of <i>n</i> putative fragment sizes,
<i>x<sub>1</sub></i>, ... , <i>x<sub>n</sub></i>, the likelihood that
the two sequences are separated by a distance of <i>θ</i> bases is
L(<i>θ</i>).
</p>

</div>
</p>

<p>
We expect the population and sample to be identically distributed,
except for a constant offset equal to the size of the gap.
</p>

<div class="formula">
	<i>f</i> (<i>x</i> | <i>θ</i>) = <i>f</i> (<i>x</i> + <i>θ</i>)
</div>

<p>
It is convenient to work with the average log-likelihood function.
</p>

</div>
</p>

<p>
The most likely estimate for the size of the gap between the two
sequences is the value of <i>θ</i> that maximizes the likelihood
function.
</p>

</p>

Finding the value of <i>θ</i> that maximizes the likelihood
function is an optimization problem. When the range of possible values
of <i>θ</i> is reasonably small, that is when the fragment size is
reasonably small, it is reasonable to calculate exhaustively every of
L(<i>θ</i>) to find the maximum, although a more efficient method
certainly exists.

<h1>Sample selection bias</h1>

<p>
We would expect the population and sample to be identically
distributed, except for a constant offset equal to the size of the
gap. This reasonables-sounding assumption is in fact incorrect. By
selecting only those fragments that originate in the first sequence
and terminate in the second sequence, that is those that span a
particular point, we are preferentially selecting large fragments.
</p>

<p>
We need the posterior probability of selecting a fragment of size
<i>x</i> given that the fragment spans the origin, p(<i>x</i>). The
prior probability distribution is the population distribution,
<i>f<sub>X</sub></i> (<i>x</i>). The likelihood function, L(<i>x</i>),
is P(spans origin | <i>X</i> = <i>x</i>). We can use Bayes thereom to
define the posterior probability distribution.
</p>

<div class=formula>
	<i>p</i>(<i>x</i>) = P(<i>X</i> = <i>x</i> | spans origins)
	<br/>
	&emsp;= P(<i>X</i> = <i>x</i>)
	∙ P(spans origin | <i>X</i> = <i>x</i>)
	/ P(spans origin)
	<br/>
	&emsp;= <i>f<sub>X</sub></i> (<i>x</i>) ∙ L(<i>x</i>)
	/ P(spans origin)
	<br/>
	P(spans origin) = Σ<sup>G</sup><sub><i>i</i>=1</sub>
	<i>f<sub>X</sub></i> (<i>i</i>) ∙ L(<i>i</i>)
</div>

<p>
The probability P(spans origin) is a normalizing constant and is
independent of <i>x</i>. To calculate the likelihood function,
L(<i>x</i>), we consider every position at which a fragment of size
<i>x</i> could originate and count the number of those fragments that
span the origin. This counting task is straight forward: a fragment
starting at one of the <i>x</i> positions to the left of the origin
will span the origin, so there are <i>x</i> such positions. The total
number of positions at which a fragment of size <i>x</i> could
originate is <i>G</i> - <i>x</i> + 1, where <i>G</i> is the size of
the genome. Assuming the genome is much larger than the fragment size,
<i>G</i> approximates this value.
</p>

<p class="formula">
L(<i>x</i>) = <i>x</i> / (<i>G</i> - <i>x</i> + 1) ≅ <i>x</i> / <i>G</i>
</p>

<p>
This constant factor of <i>G</i> in the likelihood function, cancels
with the corresponding term in the normalizing constant,
P(spans origin).

<div class=formula>
	<i>p</i>(<i>x</i>) = <i>x</i> ∙ <i>f<sub>X</sub></i> (<i>x</i>) / <i>C</i>
	<br/>
	<i>C</i> = Σ<sup>∞</sup><sub><i>i</i>=0</sub>
	<i>i</i> ∙ <i>f<sub>X</sub></i> (<i>i</i>)
</div>

<p>
Since we are only interested in the value of <i>x</i> that maximizes
<i>p</i>(<i>x</i>), the constant <i>C</i> need not be calculated.
</p>

<div class=formula>
	<i>p</i>(<i>x</i>) ∝ <i>x</i> ∙ <i>f<sub>X</sub></i> (<i>x</i>)
</div>

<p>
This result shows that a fragment that is twice as large as another
fragment is twice as likely to span an arbitrary point, which is
pleasingly intuitive. We can now use this posterior probability
distribution in the MLE in place of the population distribution.
</p>

<div class="formula">
	<i>f</i> (<i>x</i> | <i>θ</i>) = <i>p</i> (<i>x</i> + <i>θ</i>)
</div>

<h1>The effect of one short sequence</h1>

<p>
If you use the above posterior probability distribution to estimate the
size of the gap, you will find that estimates to small sequences are
in fact worse than if you had simply used the prior probability
distribution. We assume above that the two sequences are much longer
than the fragment size. If either of the sequences is short, its
effect on the distance estimate is not negligible. Consider the case
where the first sequence is long, and the second sequence is a single
base—disregarding the difficulty of mapping to a sequence of a single
base. For a fragment of size <i>x</i>, the position at which that
fragment terminates is fixed, and there is exactly one position where
that fragment can originate, <i>x</i> bases to the left of the origin.
In fact, for a sequence of size ℓ, there are min(ℓ, <i>x</i>)
positions at which that fragment could originate.
</p>

<div class=formula>
	L(<i>x</i>) ∝ min(<i>x</i>, ℓ)
	<br/>
	<i>p</i>(<i>x</i>) ∝ min(<i>x</i>, ℓ) ∙ <i>f<sub>X</sub></i> (<i>x</i>)
</div>

<h1>The effect of both sequence lengths</h1>

<p>
When we consider the sizes of both sequences, ℓ₁ and ℓ₂, there are ℓ₁
positions in the first sequence at which the fragment could originate
and two restrictions on its length: that the fragment must be at least
long enough to span the origin, and that it must be short enough that
it terminates in the second sequence. For each originating position
<i>i</i>, you can count the number of positions that satisfy these
criteria.
</p>

<div class=formula>
	L(<i>x</i>) ∝
	Σ<sup>-1</sup><sub><i>i</i> =-ℓ₁</sub>
	{ 1, 0 ≤ <i>i</i> + <i>x</i> &lt; ℓ₂;
	0, otherwise
	<br/>
	&emsp;= min(<i>x</i>, ℓ₁, ℓ₂, max(0, ℓ₁ + ℓ₂ - <i>x</i>))

<h1>Implementation</h1>

<p>
This algorithm is implemented by the <cite>ABySS</cite>
<a href="#ABySS"><sup>†</sup></a> assembly software in the utility
<i>DistanceEst</i>, which requires as its input the distribution of
fragment sizes of the library and a <i>SAM</i> file of paired reads
that map to different sequences.
